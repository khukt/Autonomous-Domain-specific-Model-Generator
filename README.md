# Autonomous-Domain-specific-Model-Generator-
The main challenging issue to utilize deep learning for various tasks such as content's popularity prediction is to efficiently choose the best-suited deep learning architecture among the various types of deep learning. Currently, domain-specific deep learning models are constructed manually by human experts, where the model construction process is a time-consuming and error-prone process. This is because the human experts need to find out the appropriate neural architectures, training procedures, regularization methods, and hyperparameters of all of these components in order to make their networks do what they are supposed to do with sufficient performance. This process has to be repeated for every application. Because of this, we are developing the opensource platform to autonomously search the appropriate deep learning architecture for problem-specific tasks (i.e., find the appropriate model among feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, etc. )as well as autonomously do the hyperparameters optimization (i.e., find the number of appropriate hidden layers, number of neurons, etc. ).
